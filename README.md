# DIALEARNER_DIABETES_PREDICTION_USING_MACHINE_LEARNING
The project "Dialearner: Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning" involves employing various machine learning 
algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Linear Regression,Decision Tree and k-Nearest 
Neighbors (KNN) for predicting diabetes. Through evaluations, it has been determined that Random Forest exhibits the 
best accuracy among these algorithms.
